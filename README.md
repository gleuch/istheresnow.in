# IsThereSnow.In?

Single serving site for checking if is snowing in your city.


### Format

Search for a city by name, postal code, or geolocation, such as:

* /New-York-City
* /10012
* /40.77,-73.98


### Method

Using basic caching, store geo location for a given place and fetch recent weather events.

Services used include Google Maps API (and NOAA Weather API -- soon!)


### TODO

* Add radius check
* Fetch weather events
* Finish styling
* Use HTML5 Geo functions to sniff out user's location
